# Universal-Compiler
This simple python script can create any program or file you can imagine using the power of the multiverse. It can also produce garbage, but only for the unlucky majority.

## Usage
To use this, follow one of two formats:
### Pre-sized file (number of bytes output_file)
ex. python UniversalCompiler.py 1000 out.txt
### Affirmations file (affirmations_file output_file)
ex. python UniversalCompiler.py aff.txt out.txt
### Evaluate what you get (use above and add "-e")
ex. python UniversalCompiler.py 1000 out.py
